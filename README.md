# fillit

The goal of this project is to make an backtracking algorithm that arranges tetriminos given to a smallest possible squarespace without rotation in given order starting from the top left and displays it on the terminal.

## Compiling
Running `make` you get an executable called `fillit`.

## Usage
`./fillit [test_file]`

## Example of valid file containing tetriminos:
```
..#.
